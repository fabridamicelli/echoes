# Ideas
  - decorrelating succesive states by means of the dynamical model
  - evaluate relationship between correlation of succesive states and performance
  - computing with SER in reservoir?:
    - equivalence weighted-binary in SER via the activation threshold
    - might hint into using just binary weights (with SER and proper threshold)
    - in Rodriguez et al, the proportion of nodes into which the input signal is injected
    is important for the performance. Does that relate to the proportion of active
    nodes in the SER model (bzw, the initialization constellations, such that the 
    network has a particular activity pattern?).

    
  - modulariry (q, n mod) and spectral radius?
